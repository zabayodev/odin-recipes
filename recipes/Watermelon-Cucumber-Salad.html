    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        All of my friends loved this tasty, refreshing watermelon salad, 
        so I thought I would add it as my first Allrecipes recipe. 
        It was inspired by another recipe on here, but strayed far enough 
        from the original that I thought it deserved its own recipe. Enjoy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li> 1 large seedless watermelon, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

        <li>coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
